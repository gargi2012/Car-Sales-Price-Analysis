# Car-Sales-Price-Analysis
This project is based on a dataset obtained from cardekho that contains information of cars sold in the year 2020 and whose goal is to figure out what, among the attributes of a car in the dataset, determines the selling price of a car. 
Initial analysis was done on Python and the end result was an R-Shiny dashboard that summarised the analysis into an interactive and visual app.
# Methodology
Analysis was done on the data to find out if the variables are correlated to each other.The result obtained was that there appears to be a strong correlation between age of a car and the selling price.
